# Pytest configuration file
# This file tells pytest how to discover and run tests

# Test discovery patterns
# Only collect tests from the tests/ directory
# Ignore scripts/ directory (those are utility scripts, not pytest tests)
testpaths = tests

# Python files and directories to ignore during test collection
norecursedirs = scripts __pycache__ .git .venv venv env node_modules

# Python files matching these patterns will be collected as tests
python_files = test_*.py

# Python classes matching these patterns will be collected as test classes
python_classes = Test*

# Python functions matching these patterns will be collected as test functions
python_functions = test_*

# Minimum Python version
minversion = 6.0

# Add options
# -v: verbose output
# --tb=short: shorter traceback format
addopts = -v --tb=short

# Markers for categorizing tests
markers =
    slow: marks tests as slow (deselect with '-m "not slow"')
    integration: marks tests as integration tests
    unit: marks tests as unit tests
